# Importing cluster data
A csv file will be supplied by Data Science, possibly by encrypted file transfer. Robin Linacre is currently responsible for transferring the file to us.

## Creating the schema and table
Connect to the database [using the process defined](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/other-topics/rds-external-access.html)

If the `personmatchscore` schema, does not exist:
Copy and paste the SQL from  [CPR-356-create-personmatchscore-schema](./CPR-356-create-personmatchscore-schema.sql) and execute it

If the `personmatchscore.splink_cluster` table does not exist:
Copy and paste the SQL from  [CPR-356-create-splink-cluster.sql](./CPR-356-create-splink-cluster.sql) and execute it

#### Data import

Compare the column names with the table splink_cluster as defined in [CPR-356-create-splink-cluster.sql](./CPR-356-create-splink-cluster.sql) and amend the csv file to match the column names. For example, `rename offender_id_display` to `prison_number`

Connect to the database [using the process defined](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/other-topics/rds-external-access.html)

Right-click on the `splink-cluster` table and select `Import Data`

Go through the wizard. Make sure you
- select CSV on `Import source`
- browse for the csv file on your local machine
- expand the Tables Mapping and check that all the fields in the csv match the columns in the `splink-cluster` table
- Enable `truncate target table` on the Data Load Settings page

The import will take several minutes

## Linking cluster data
#### NOTE If you are running locally

run `./gradlew check` to create some CRNs and Prison numbers

#### Otherwise
Once you have imported the cluster data, 
Connect to the database [using the process defined](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/other-topics/rds-external-access.html)

### Assumption: there is no valuable data in person_identifier
### Delete the existing links
Copy and paste the SQL from  [CPR-356-deleting-existing-links.sql](./CPR-356-deleting-existing-links.sql) and execute it

### Populate the links
Copy and paste the SQL from  [CPR-356-generate-person-ids.sql](./CPR-356-generate-person-ids.sql) and execute it

## Reporting on cluster data

Connect to the database [using the process defined](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/other-topics/rds-external-access.html)

Copy and paste the SQL from  [CPR-357-reporting.sql](./CPR-357-reporting.sql) and execute it
