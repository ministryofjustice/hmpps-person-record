  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  <p>This service provides an endpoint to retrieve a person by UUID.</p>
  <h2 id="data-provided">Data provided</h2>
  <p>The vast majority of the data is sourced from the CPR Record which gets the data from Nomis, Delius & HMCTS source systems.</p>
  <div>The data returned for each person record is essentially data that has been retrieved from Nomis, Delius or HMCTS. This includes the
    following:
    <ul>
      <li>Identifiers from any of the following source systems : Nomis, Delius & HMCTS</li>
      <li>Source System itself, so whether it from Nomis, Delius or HMCTS source system.</li>
    </ul>
    See the schema definition for the API for full details.
  </div>
  <h2 id="role-restrictions">Role restrictions</h2>
  <p>
    Role restrictions in this service are applied by a `@PreAuthorize` annotation at either resource or service level.
    Furthermore the annotation can be applied at individual method level or class level.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each endpoint in this API documentation should normally include what restrictions are applied. If there is any doubt
    then it is worth looking at the github repository
    <a href = "https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-person-record/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/uk/gov/justice/digital/hmpps/personrecord/api/controller/SearchController.kt"> here</a> and looking at the endpoint in question.
